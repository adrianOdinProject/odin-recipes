        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The dish takes its name from the wide, shallow traditional pan used to cook the dish on an open fire, paella
            being the word for a frying pan in Valencia's regional language. As a dish, it may have ancient roots, but
            in its modern form it is traced back to the mid-19th century, in the rural area around the Albufera lagoon
            adjacent to the city of Valencia, on the Mediterranean coast of Spain.[5]</p>
        <p>Paella valenciana is the traditional paella of the Valencia region, believed to be the original recipe,[6]
            and consists of round-grain rice,[7] bajoqueta and tavella (varieties of green beans), rabbit, chicken,
            sometimes duck, and garrofó (a variety of lima or butter bean), cooked in olive oil and chicken broth.[8][9]
            The dish is sometimes seasoned with whole rosemary branches. Traditionally, the yellow color comes from
            saffron, but turmeric and calendula can be used as substitutes. Artichoke hearts and stems may be used as
            seasonal ingredients. Most paella cooks use bomba rice, but Valencians tend to use a cultivar known as
            senia.[10]</p>
